Thank you GitHub!

Finally, a company that realizes that students are nothing but broke. Offering the education pack is helping me achieve my goal of becoming an even bigger nerd than I am. Not only that, but they are helping me realize the power of the GitHub platform. Since applying for the education pack, I have figured out how to use the GitHub platform, and also helped me setup a website where I can share my thoughts, things I learn, and whatever I want.

For those who are confused as to why I am writing this, I want to share this amazing package with them. GitHub Education is a pack of tools that are bundled together and can be obtained by submitting proof of being associated with an institution of education. With this, you get access to a free domain, free SSL certificate, DigitalOcean credit (but for what ever reason trying to use this will get you banned from the DigitalOcean platform, not GitHub&#39;s fault though), and several other resources that will help you become a master at anything development/nerd related. And, it means a lot. Not everyone has the money to pay for these amazing things, yet here is GitHub and several other companies who have joined together to help further the education and discoveries of us broke students. It means a lot.

If you are interested, please check out [this link.](https://education.github.com/) This will explain more and give you guys the opportunity to apply.

Also, sorry for the bad quality of this post. I am trying to get into journalism. I promise, just stick around. The quality will improve, I swear!
